## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

I was able to play around with flex, specifically justifying content evenly on opposite sides. 

### Continued development

I'd love to dive even further into how to customize Bootstrap as well as practicing the CSS Box Model for styling.

### Useful resources

- [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/card/) - This was the foundation of my project and made building the card component very easy. The documentation is a wonderful resource on how to build the card.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) - MDN is of course my go to resource for all things HTML and CSS. Specifically I used this resource when trying to remember the padding syntax.
[Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - Google Fonts was used and will be for many projects if not all.
